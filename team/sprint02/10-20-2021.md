### Alberto
Since last meeting I kept learning technologies. I talked with Hardy about the anime list table. For today, I'll try to work on the issue I was assigned. By next meeting,
I will keep learning new technologies and work on new issues.
### Chris
Since last meeting I worked with Justin to create the anime search list feature using AniList graphql. I also did CATME. 
For today, I will work on search component so it can be reusable. By next meeting, I plan to finalize the issue and get it reviewed.
### Justin
Since last meeting, I worked with Chris on my anime search issue. We currenlty have a draft PR for that. Today, I will finish up that issue so it can be ready for review.
By next meeting, I hope to have that merged in and we will continue to work on connecting the backend to the frontend for listing user's anime and ratings for our MVP.
### Hardy
Since last meeting, I set up simpl einterface for frontend. For today, I will do CATME evaluation. By next meeting, I hope I can finish the frontend issue with real data. (Same as
Justin's goal)
