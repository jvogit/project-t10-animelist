## Team updates

### Rowan

Since last meeting, read up on GraphQL docs to get more familiar with implementing the API. Currently blocked because we need to copy the code from Justin's Hello World repo. Planning to continue reading about GraphQL and work on adding Mongo libraries to backend once unblocked.

### Alberto

Finished HW3 and learned some HTML. Planning to keep learning HTML and maybe start learning JS and CSS today. By next meeting, will finish the next HW and hopefully learn more about the previously mentioned topics.

### Chris

Finished HW3 and expanded the README with more information about the project and chosen tech stack. Worked with Justin to help migrate the Hello World project to the team repo, set up the Mongo database, and link that with our backend. By next meeting, planning to finalize those issues and finish HW4.

### Justin

Worked with Chris on migrating Hello World to repository. Set up MongoDB and connected it to the app. Planning to make a PR to merge those changes to the main branch and finish those issues.

### Hardy

Learned about React and some other frontend topics. Will continue to learn frontend today. By next meeting, planning to finish HW4 and keep learning HTML/CSS.
