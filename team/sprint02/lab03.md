## Team updates

### Chris
Since the last meeting, I finalized my issues with Justin, submitted some code reviews/approvals, and Justin and I moved everything completed to the Done column of the Kanban board. By the next meeting, I intend to have another issue assigned to myself and begin work on it. 


### Rowan
Since the last meeting, I set up my development environment and made a small PR to create a place holder page for our user's anime list. By the next meeting, I plan to continue my learning on GraphQL and peruse through the user stories, so I may assign myself a new one.


### Alberto
Since the last meeting, I worked on and finalized my issue. I merged my changes to the main branch as well. By the next meeting, I will look into other issues and potentially start and/or finish the new one.


### Justin
Since the last meeting, I did a lot of code reviews for Alberto, Hardy, ad Rowan's PRs. Today I will work through the lab with the other groupmmates. By next meeting, I will look over the issues and pick a new one to work on for the next Sprint.


### Hardy
Since last meeting, I set up the front and back end on my local environment and worked on my assigned issue. By the next meeting, I will continue to learn Next.js and React.
