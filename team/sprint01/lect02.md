## Discussion:

I (Rowan) merged my personal PR and finished HW01. Before next standup I want to at least start on the Hello World app.

Alberto merged the PR for the team meeting file. Before next standup he plans to brainstorm what language and technology we can use for the Hello World project and start working on that.

Justin merged his personal PR, submitted HW01 on Gradescope and started on the Hello World repository. By the next meeting he plans on completing the Hello World application and fleshing out some of his ideas for the app.

Chris also merged his personal PR and completed HW01. Before next meeting he wants to start the Hello World app and do some exploration of tech options. He also ran into some technical issues with his computer so took some time to set up a new one.

Hardy finished HW01 and set up his GitHub environment for development. Before next meeting he plans to start working on the Hello World app.
