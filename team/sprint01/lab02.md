# Hello World Demo and Tech Stacks

## Christopher 
I used Node.js's express.js and React for my tech stack and deployed the backend branch only on Heroku after including all the build files into the backend folder.

## Alberto
I used React for my frontend and express.js for my backend. I deployed my frontend to Heroku successfully. 

## Rowan 
I used Next.js, (frontend) and flask (backend) and succesfully deployed using two separate Heroku apps.

## Justin
I used next.js for frontend and springboot for the backend. The backend is on Heroku and the front end is on Vercel. I used github actions to automatically deploy to both Heroku and Vercel. I created basic Login and Sign up functionality. I was also able link MAL accounts with newly created accounts as well.

## Hardy
I used React for frontend and for my backend I used express.js. I deployed my app on Heroku without the need for separate deployments for frontend and backend.
