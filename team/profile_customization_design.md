# Profile Customization System

## Introduction

One of the key design principles for our AnimeList project is to allow the user as much personalization and control over their anime list experience as possible. However, we should also ensure that this customization does not compromise the ease of use of the application, and we should avoid forcing users to "opt in" to this customization. That is, users should be able to have an intuitive app experience without needing to spend a significant amount of time customizing their profile.

With these principles in mind, this design document will describe a proposed system for implementing a profile customization system. Currently, the user's profile page is essentially a placeholder left over from the first implementation of our project. It only displays some internal information about the logged-in user.

We want the profile page to be the user's "personal space," a customizable page that they can use to showcase their list(s) and other information about themselves. This design document will describe a way to make the page (1) display useful information and (2) provide customization capabilities for the user.
