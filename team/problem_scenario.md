# Problem Scenario

Our users are anime/manga enjoyers who reach a point where they want to maintain a catalog of what they've watched, their thoughts and ratings on those, and what they plan to watch in the future.

They may have already tried some of the more popular alternatives, namely MyAnimeList, but desired something more customizable and exactly catered to their personal wants for maintaining a catalog of their watched anime.

This leads them to our app, something that provides the same basic functionality as MyAnimeList but with more capability for the user to customize their collection, both in their ability to rate and manage their anime collection, and in the way that information is displayed.
