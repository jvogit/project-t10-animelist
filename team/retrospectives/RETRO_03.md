## Retro Assessment

* We continue with the Start/Stop/Continue process on a GitHub project board.
* The retro was a bit slow to start, as we had already accomplished the main action items from last retro. However, we eventuallyi brought up some good action items for discussion.
* For next retro, we should continue to emphasize participation. A good leader should be selected to invoke the most engagement from others as possible.
