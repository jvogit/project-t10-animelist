# Date of Retrospective: 10/13/21

- Led by: Rowan
- Present: Alberto, Chris, Justin, Hardy
- Absent: n/a

## Action Items

### Increased Communication

- Goal: communicate more as a team
- Change: make it part of standup to evaluate if we need an additional meeting before our next scheduled class meeting. if so, schedule a Zoom meeting and use that to work as a team. also make more use of Slack to relay updates immediately
- Measurement: number of meetings we have per sprint, (informally) how much we feel like we're communicating

### Ramp Up Development

- Goal: get everyone set up to start working on code towards our MVP
- Change: everyone should spend some time setting up their local development environment. check in with everyone over next few days to make sure that they're set up
- Measurement: number of set-up development environments and number of code PRs being submitted

## Additional Things to Remember

- Make sure everyone is communicating openly!
- Avoid talking about homeworks during daily standups.
- Keep learning about the tech stack as a whole. But keep in mind that we are planning to specialize in one area of the project at some point.

## Retro Assessment

- We used the start/stop/continue template for this retro. I set up a project board on GitHub and had each team member add anything they thought of as a card to the corresponding column. After 5 minutes, we reconvened and discussed how to turn the cards we added into action items.
- The retro went fairly well. I feel that not everyone (myself included) was very active in participating, so for the next retro we should make sure everyone is comfortable speaking up.
- For the next person: make sure that you directly ask each person to make sure they aren't keeping any thoughts to themselves.
