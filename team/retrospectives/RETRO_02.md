## Retro Assessment

* We use the Start/Stop/Continue process on a GitHub projetc board.
* The retro went well. We've identified some things to change and things to start doing to make our development process smoother. I felt more people are participating than last retro
* For next retro, actively continue to encourage participation. This can be done by addressing members directly in a positive manner in order to make them feel included and heard.
