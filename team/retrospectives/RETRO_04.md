# Date of Retrospective: 11/22/21

* Led by: Christopher
* Present: Alberto, Christopher, Hardy, Justin
* Absent: Rowan (staying in touch on Slack)

## Action items

### Begin work on Profile Customization. Kick this into high gear with our deadline in mind.
* a goal: implement one of our core features: profile customization
* a change: We will finish writing user stories / issues and begin assigning ourselves to them
* a measurement: Our kanban board will reflect the amount of profile customization related issues

### Keep everyone assigned to at least one issue at all times.
* a goal: Keep everyone engaged and working on something at all times.
* a change: There is no main change other than to continue assigning ourselves to issues after the completion of each one.
* a measurement: We will be routinely checking our kanban board to ensure everyone is assigned something at all times.

## Retro Assessment

* We use the Start/Stop/Continue process on a GitHub project board.
* The retro went well. We've identified some things to start and what has been working for us.
* For next retro (if necessary), we will actively continue to encourage participation. This can be done by addressing members directly in a positive manner in order to make them feel included and heard.
