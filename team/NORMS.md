# Team Norms for Team 10 (AnimeList)

- We make a PR for all non-trivial code changes.
- Each PR should receive two code reviews before being merged.
- Everyone should freely ask for help in the Slack channel or in-person if any blockers arise.
- Everyone should also let the team know through Slack channel or in-person if they're running behind on a deliverable and aren't on track to meet the deadline.
