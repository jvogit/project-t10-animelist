## Other Comments

- This was my first time working in a web development project and I tried my best to learn
- I tried to do things on my own and I also often pair programmed with Justin to work on issues
- I learned a lot, especially when I worked with Justin on issues
- I feel like I could have done so much more for the project, but I had other classes that were equally as time consuming as the project
- I feel like I'll be more capable of doing things on my own the next time I work on another web development project
