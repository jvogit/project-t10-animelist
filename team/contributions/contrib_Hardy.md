## Other Comments
- This is my first time to use programming language to make an APP. I am very grateful to my teammates for their enthusiasm.
- I pair programmed with Justin and Rowan,Thank you Rowan for teaching me live how to connect the back end and the front end. And Justin was kind enough to help me solve all kinds of problems and show me how to programã€‚
- Sometimes I feel a little confused, I need to add more knowledge. Because I'm already familiar with how to develop an app, right.
- I am sure I will be familiar with how to communicate and work with peers in the future programming development
