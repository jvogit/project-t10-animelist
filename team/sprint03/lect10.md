- Since last meeting, I went over the feedback received. Today, I'll work on lab requirements. By next meeting, hopefully I'll have an issue assigned to myself and work on it.

## Hardy

- Since last meeting, I didn't do too much. For today, I'll think about what kind of test to do. By next meeting, I'll think about how to work on the profile system for our app.
