## Team updates

### Chris
Since the last meeting, I added acceptance criteria to one of my issues and reviewed Justin's design document for the customizable scoring functionality. Today, I plan to begin work on lab5 requirements and potentially assign myself a new issue. By the next meeting, I will have some of these requirements completed with the group.


### Rowan
Since the last meeting, I added acceptance criteria to previously completed issues. Over the next week, I plan to look over issues and look over the testing frameworks and potentially integrate this into our project devlopment. 

### Alberto
Since the last meeting, I haven't done too much, aside from continuing the learning process. For today, I plan to get readjusted to the project and look over some issues potentially. By the next meeting, I intend to continue learning javascript, assign myself a potential issue, and hopefully finish some lab requirements.

### Justin
Since the last meeting, I mainly worked on the design document for the rating system; I have a draft prepared for feedback. Today I will continue working on that and by next meeting, hopefully everyone will be on board with the design; from there, we can begin creating new issues.

### Hardy
Since the last meeting, I went through our code and read some articles about queries and functions. For today, I plan to ask questions and learn more about things I didn't understand. By next meeting, I will watch some tutorials to help me continue learning.
