# Team Learning Discussion

## Current Level of Knowledge

- Justin is already familiar with the whole tech stack besides MongoDB.
- Rowan is already familiar with most of the tech stack. A bit unfamiliar with GraphQL (have only used from the client perspective) and have some knowledge of Mongo but need to brush up.
- Alberto is relatively unfamiliar. Maybe can pair with another developer with more experience.
- Chris is moderately familiar with React and Spring Boot (from 156) but needs to brush up. Also needs to learn about GraphQL and Mongo.
- Hardy is unfamiliar but has some friends with knowledge about both frontend and backend.

## Gaps

- The biggest gap of knowledge is with Mongo, which none of us are especially familiar with.
- Besides Justin, we also need to learn more about GraphQL.
- Some of us would also like to learn more about React and/or Spring Boot.

## Learning Plan

- Justin will watch YouTube videos in the next few weeks to learn about Mongo.
- Rowan will read documentation over the next two weeks to learn about GraphQL as well as Mongo.
- Alberto will look into the resources spreadsheet over the next two weeks. Rowan will also do some pair programming once we start implementing issues to share some knowledge on that.
- Chris will watch tutorials and pair with Justin.
- Hardy will watch online courses on React and Spring Boot and will try to get some help from friends on learning the language. If needed, Rowan will also do some pair programming with Hardy.

## Articles Documentation

Christopher Barnett (10/18): I shared https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-restore in the git_articles Slack channel. It touches on the git restore command, which helped one of our team members correct having mistakenly added files to his PR.

Hardy Xu (10/19) : I shared https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp.
The following website is a very useful resource for anyone who is a newer in html ,css, js study. I learn by myself through this website. I hope it will be helpful to some other classmates!

Rowan Tran (10/20): I shared https://graphql.org/learn/ in the #backend_articles channel. It covers the basics of GraphQL, and I used this tutorial to learn more about how it works and get comfortable making some backend changes.
