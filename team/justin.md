# Project Ideas
- Customizable ranking system. Users should be able to customize how they score their anime, how the ranking system looks like, which ranking system to use
- Shareable ranking systems. Users can share their crafted ranking systems with each other on a "marketplace" for other users to use and then customize
- MAL, Anilist import/epxort. Able to import and export from and to MAL/Anilist. Able to login with MAL or Anilist account and start right away
- The "rankings critiuqes" feature: an opt in feature where users can release their rankings to the public for critique and in return they can also critique others as well
to earn clout and respect. Maybe they also get a shiny badge to their profile as a "Critic"
