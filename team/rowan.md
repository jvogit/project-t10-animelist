## Introduction

I'm Rowan, a third-year CS student at UCSB. I consider myself a semi-avid anime/manga fan so this project is pretty interesting to me.

## Project Ideas

My vision for this project is a tool like MAL that allows tracking watched anime and manga, but with 2 main improvements:

1. A more intuitive and modern interface. Anilist is a good example of such an interface.
2. More features catered to "power users," such as easier profile page customization and more options to order the list by different criteria.
