## Team updates

## Alberto

- Since last meeting, I worked on the page to create a rating system, haven't finished yet. For today, I will try to keep working on the issue. By next meeting, hopefully I'll be able to finish the issue.

## Chris

- Since last meeting, I began working on the rating system schema on the backend. The blocker that I had was typing an issue and resolving it. For today, I'll continue working on the issue. By next meeting, I'll finish working on my issue.

## Justin

- Since last meeting, I pushed a PR for backend issue, I worked with Hardy on an issue. For today, I will work on PR reviews and work with Chris on the rating system algorithm. By next meeting, hopefully I'll finish with the rating system algorithm and work on the frontend to make it look nicer.

## Hardy

- Since last meeting, I worked with Justin to implement the rating system validation. For today, I'll work on unit tests. By next meeting, I'll try to work on a new issue and the lab.

## Rowan

- Since last meeting, I did the first draft for our first design doc and made a PR for that, I also started on the design for the profile customization, but right now that's one of my blockers. For today, I'll work with Justing on the profile customization design. By next meeting, hopefully I'll finish the design document.
